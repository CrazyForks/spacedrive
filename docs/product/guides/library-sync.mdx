Syncing libraries across devices is one of the core features of Spacedrive. There are two methods of syncing available in Spacedrive:

- **Peer to Peer** - Syncing your library across devices on the same local network, without the need for an internet connection.
- **Cloud Sync** - Utilizing the Spacedrive network to sync your library across devices over the internet, securely and privately.
